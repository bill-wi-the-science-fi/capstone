//await that entry into database

//if that passes, then send the email with pin.....

//user reads email- clicks to signup

//user should sign up using a special link /signup/nominee (front end)
//backend route = users/nominee

//enters pin on form

//when the user hits the post route (generic), we need to check if user previously existed or not

//if user existed, and doesnt provide a pin send error (nominee) ask to sign up with pin

//if user did not exist but tries to provide a pin send a error

//if user existed, and did provide a pin and its verified-great (nominee)

//if user didnt exist, and didnt provide a pin-great
